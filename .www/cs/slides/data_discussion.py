 1) Data Discussion
 Take a look at: https://provost.northeastern.edu/uds/cds/2020-2021/
 What information does this dataset include?
 - men and women (undergrads, grads)
 - percentage participating in extra curriculars
 - financial aid awards (how much federal, how much school based)
 - percentage of students out of state
 - portion of faculty with diff degrees
 - tuition & broken up for room & board etc
 - what the 25th & 75th percentiles are on SAT/ACT

 What information does this dataset not include?
 (but that it might reaesonably include)
 - (no graphs or visuals)
 - admission rate & deeper breakdown of those numbers
 - some sections are missing numbers
 - information about percentages in NUin
 - information about both gender & racial/ethic demographics
 - information about non-binary students?

 What kinds of questions might we be able to investigate with this data?
 - questions about how enrollment has changed over the last decade

 What kinds of questions might we *think* that we 
 could investigate with this data, but that we can't
 actually?
 - how does retention/persistance correspond to involvement in
 extracurriculars?
 - any question that involves overlapping categories that do not exist in 
 the data
 
 Now, compare this dataset with the one from 2010 - 2011
 Can we answer the same questions?
 
 
 2) Is the data from the Common Data Set 
 that we are looking at monolithic
 or disaggregated?
- monolithic: represents one number, not broken into sub categories
- disaggregated: broken up according to sub categories
