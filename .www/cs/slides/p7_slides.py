Final Project:

0) Questions?
    
    
1) If you are looking for a group/teammate and don't have one yet:
    a) Look on the Canvas discussion for teammates, see if 
    one of the projects matches your interests/work schedule well!

Group questions from last time that we're going to discuss now:
1) What _types_ can we pass as parameters to 
    the same_length function?

2) What does a function return when it has no
    return statement (like in pretty_print)?
